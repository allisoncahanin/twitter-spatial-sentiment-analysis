 The purpose of this project is to explore methods of extracting information from big data sources and evaluate how this will impact sociological research. Unlike traditional methods of social research, which have established rules and methodologies to maintain the quality of the results, gathering social information from digital sources is largely an uncharted field (Diaz-Bone, 2020). By documenting challenges with analysis and areas where results could be misleading, this project aims to create discussion about effective methods of tracking and measuring cultural trends using the statistical programming language R.
